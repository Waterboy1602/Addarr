# ADDARR

[![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/waterboy1602/addarr)](https://hub.docker.com/r/waterboy1602/addarr)

This is a Telegram Bot made to add series to [Sonarr](https://github.com/Sonarr/Sonarr), movies to [Radarr](https://github.com/Radarr/Radarr) or artists to [Lidarr](https://github.com/lidarr/Lidarr) with a couple of commands. You can also communicate with your [Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/)/[Sabnzbd](https://sabnzbd.org/) service to change its download speed. The bot uses the InlineKeyboard to let you select the wanted commands, as you can see in the [screenshots](#screenshots).

## CONFIG

An example of the config file (`config_example.yaml`) can be found in this repository. Change it to your configuration. After you've filled in all the necessary fields, rename it to `config.yaml`.

## ADMIN

There is a functionality to only let admins use the `transmission` command, list or delete series/movies/artists from `sonarr`/`radarr`/`lidarr`. Before you can use this, you should enable each variable in the config file `config.yaml`. Then you need to add the admins to `admin.txt`. You can add the `username` or `id` of the user. Every added user should be on a new line to prevent errors.

## ALLOWLIST

There is a very restrictive functionality to only reply to already approved users. You can enable it in the config file `config.yaml`. Then you need to add the users to `allowlist.txt`. You can add the `username` or `id` of the user. Every added user should be on a new line to prevent errors.
