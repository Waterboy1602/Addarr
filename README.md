# ADDARR

[![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/waterboy1602/addarr)](https://hub.docker.com/r/waterboy1602/addarr)

This is a Telegram Bot made to add series to [Sonarr](https://github.com/Sonarr/Sonarr) or movies to [Radarr](https://github.com/Radarr/Radarr) with a couple of commands. You can also communicate with your [Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/)/[Sabnzbd](https://sabnzbd.org/) service to change its download speed. The bot uses the InlineKeyboard to let you select the wanted commands, as you can see in the [screenshots](#screenshots).

## FEATURES

- Add series/movies to Sonarr/Radarr
- Multiple instances of Sonarr/Radarr supported
- Get a list of all the series on Sonarr
- Change down-/uploadspeed of Transmission (Temporary Speed Limit)
- Secure bot with a password. New chats first need to authenticate
- Wrong login attempts are saved in `addarr.log`
- Possibility to enable the Transmission-command only for admins
- Possibility to change the entrypoints of the commands
- Translated in English (US), Dutch (Belgium), Spanish (Spain), Italian (Italy), Portuguese (Portugal), Polish (Poland), German (Germany) and French (France)
- Command to give an overview of all the other commands

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Addarr only works with Sonarr V4, because of some breaking API changes between V3 and V4.

## COMMANDS

These are the default commands:

- `/help`: gives an overview of all the commands with their action

- `/start`: start adding a series or movie to Sonarr/Radarr
- `/delete`: remove a series or movie from Sonarr/Radarr

- `/stop`: stops the command you were executing. Can be used at any moment  

Every command does also work if you send a message without `/` and no other words before or after the entrypoint

### Single Line Commands

Single line commands allow you to skip multiple steps of the process

- `Find {movie | series} {title}`: will bring you directly to Title selection step. If you have multiple instances of Sonarr/Radarr setup, you will need to select to which instance you want to add the title to. For example if you want to find the title "Wrong Turn" you would type `Find movie Wrong Turn` or to find a tv show `Find series iZombie`


## CONFIG

An example of the config file (`config_example.yaml`) can be found in this repository. Change it to your configuration. After you've filled in all the necessary fields, rename it to `config.yaml`.

## ADMIN

There is a functionality to only let admins use the `transmission` command, list or delete series/movies from `sonarr`/`radarr`. Before you can use this, you should enable each variable in the config file `config.yaml`. Then you need to add the admins to `admin.txt`. You can add the `username` or `id` of the user. Every added user should be on a new line to prevent errors.

## ALLOWLIST

There is a very restrictive functionality to only reply to already approved users. You can enable it in the config file `config.yaml`. Then you need to add the users to `allowlist.txt`. You can add the `username` or `id` of the user. Every added user should be on a new line to prevent errors.
