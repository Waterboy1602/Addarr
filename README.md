# ADDARR
[![Docker Cloud Build Status](https://img.shields.io/docker/cloud/build/waterboy1602/addarr)](https://hub.docker.com/r/waterboy1602/addarr)

This is a TelegramBot made to add series to [Sonarr](https://github.com/Sonarr/Sonarr) or movies to [Radarr](https://github.com/Radarr/Radarr) with a couple of commands.

## HOW IT WORKS
You can start the bot with sending `/start` or just `start` (other entrypoints can be set in config). At any time you can stop with the bot by sending `/stop` or `stop`.<br/>The first time you use `start` you will be asked to enter your password you set in the config file. You will only need to do this one time. The chatId will be saved to a file and be checked there every time.<br/>There will be made a log to the logfile when you enter a wrong password: timestamp, username and entered password.<br/>The next steps will be made clear by the bot.
