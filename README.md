# ADDARR

This is a TelegramBot made to add series to [Sonarr](https://github.com/Sonarr/Sonarr) or movies to [Radarr](https://github.com/Radarr/Radarr with a couple of commands.

## HOW IT WORKS
You can start the bot with sending a message or command 'start'

The rest will be made clear by the bot

## INSTALLATION
For the moment I only made a wikipage for installation on FreeBSD. If there is interest for other wikipages, just tell me and I will look for it.
